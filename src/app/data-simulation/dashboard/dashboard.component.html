  <h2 class="title">Welcome to disease simulation app</h2>

  <div class="text-wrapper">
    <p>In this application user can simulate spread of disease. There are some initial data to describe disease and
      group of population.</p>
    <p>First it is necessary to give the number of population and initial number of infected people.</p>
    <p>Second it is necessary to give the period of time of simulation, necessary time to recover and time
      after that infected person can die. Time is counted in days.</p>
    <p>Finally there are two factors to describe type of disease:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First one is factor of spread of disease. This factor describes how fast disease spreads. If this factor
          is equal or less than 1 that disease will not spread
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Second one is mortality factor. This factor describes the probability of death of ill person. Maximal value
          for this factor is 1 that means 100% probability of death. Minimal value
          is 0 that means no ill person will die.
        </p>
